# GitHub Copilot SDK Cookbook — Java

This folder hosts short, practical recipes for using the GitHub Copilot SDK with Java. Each recipe is concise, copy‑pasteable, and points to fuller examples and tests.

## Prerequisites

All cookbook examples can be run directly using [JBang](https://www.jbang.dev/), which allows you to run Java code without a full project setup.

**Install JBang:**

```bash
# macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install jbangdev/tap/jbang

# Linux/macOS (using curl)
curl -Ls https://sh.jbang.dev | bash -s - app setup

# Windows (using Scoop)
scoop install jbang
```

For other installation methods, see the [JBang installation guide](https://www.jbang.dev/download/).
